            <li class="tripoli-citadel-p">The mosque is distinguished by its magnificent artistic design and traditional Islamic architecture, and is an integral part of Lebanon's cultural and religious heritage.</li>
            <li class="tripoli-citadel-p">The Great Mansuri Mosque is one of the greatest mosques in the city of Tripoli, northern Lebanon.</li>
            <li class="tripoli-citadel-p">It was built by the Mamluks in batches starting in 1294 AD.</li>

                <li class="tripoli-citadel-p">It is the first architectural landmark to be erected in Mamluk Tripoli, where it was named the Great Al-Mansuri Mosque after the name of the conqueror of Tripoli, “Al-Mansur Qalawun,” and because it was and still is the largest mosque in the old city.</li>
                <li class="tripoli-citadel-p">Its construction is characterized by its simplicity and lack of decoration, but it is known for its semi-square minaret and main gate, in addition to the presence of a sundial to determine the times of the call to prayer.</li>
                <li class="tripoli-citadel-p">Perhaps the most notable addition to the features of this mosque was the gift of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to the city of Tripoli and its people, a hair from the beard of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, from the archives of the Holy Trusts in Istanbul, and it was preserved in the Grand Mansuri Mosque.</li>
